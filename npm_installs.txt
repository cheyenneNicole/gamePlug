If your program does not work run these commands in game-plug:
npm install react
npm add react react-dom react-native-web
npm install bootstap
npm install reactstrap
npm install material-ui/core
AFTER you do git pull, just do npm install and 
it will install everything you are missing
If it still doesnt work go to package.json and install the 
dependencies you haven't install already
